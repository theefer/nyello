                      ~~~  NYELLO  ~~~

nyello ("singer" in Quenya) is a command-line XMMS2 client.  It aims
at providing a high-level interface to the XMMS2 server, with a
concise and powerful interaction syntax.  It can either run a single
command or work like a shell (if started without argument).  As a
command-line program, it is mostly targetted at Unix power-users.

The experience and work earned by developping nyello will then be used
to develop a full-feature, more newbie-friendly graphical XMMS2
client.  But that's in the future...

Until then, enjoy the program and feel free to modify and redistribute
it!
