  [-] Architecture of the elements
  [-] Overall structure of the classes and modules
  [X] Connect modules
  [X] Simple commands (start, pause, stop)
  [X] Parse arguments to commands
  [X] More commands (previous, next)
  [X] Playlist basic commands (list of PL, save as, delete)
  [X] Handle playlists internally (use)
  [X] Prepare an output module to show results (column objects, displayable entry objects)
  [X] Develop a clever Printable class usable for diff. types of data (value, retrieval)
  [X] Test the output module (list songs, current playlist, given playlist)
  [X] More features in output (selection, counter column, align, zero-count of songs in playlist)
  [X] Develop pattern representation
  [X] Pattern parsing into the representation
  [X] Command-line arguments to the program parsed as commands
  [X] Pattern testing with medialib (info, enqueue)
  [X] New enqueue methods (replace, insert) when available in clientlib
  ==> v0.1

  [X] Make result counter start at 0 and adapt sequences to match that
  [X] Fix bug causing endless loop for "INFO +99"
  [X] Avoid invalid queries ("WHERE ()")
  [X] Fix sequence hack (problem with templates)
  [X] Improve help (summary and per-command)
  [X] Improve pattern features (orderby)
  [X] Ignore and protect playlists starting with '_'
  ==> v0.2

  [X] Configure script, using autoconf/automake
  [X] Allow escaped spaces and quoted string to be a single token
  [ ] Code cleanup, bugs, FIXME's (Printable class tree, playlist-list, etc)
  [X] Read the XMMS_PATH env var to open the server connection
  [X] Improve pattern features (order by rand())
  [X] More commands (clear, shuffle, jump, status, remove)
  [X] Fixed parsing order bug (fixes "info -7")
  [X] Fixed the playlist-list command that returned incorrect results
  ==> v0.3

  [ ] Make readline use async, redesign main-loop, remove waits
  [ ] Brainstorm on abstraction layer, make it reliable, dynamic (broadcast, etc)
R [ ] Design proper abstraction layer (all async events, current PL, collections)
  [ ] Develop collection handling and classes
  [ ] Save collections in a file (apply, save as, delete)
R [ ] Handle collections internally (enter)
R [ ] Randomize playlist from a collection (playlist-random)

Unscheduled fixes (by order of importance, most important first)
  [ ] Improve pattern features (comparators, limit)
  [ ] More commands (seek, exclude, filter)
  [ ] Correct display, using wcs instead of str?
  [ ] Free all the allocated memory, i.e. fix the leaks!
  [ ] Should '#' match '1#0-' ?
  [ ] When no metadata is present, display Title=filename
  [ ] Generalize the #argument check in the dispatcher
  [ ] TODO should show the played percentage
  [ ] Templatize the STATUS output

Known bugs
  [ ] "info 2 OR /" always returns an empty set, which is wrong (due to ORDER BY in subquery)
  [ ] REMOVE can behave wrong if the active playlist and the matching saved playlist differ
  [ ] NOT and XOR not working at all
